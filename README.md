# Digital-Steganography
<p>
Steganography is the technique that provides the base for secure communication.
It is the art of Data Hiding in some other means of false medium for making a
possible secure communication. .Using steganography, information can be hidden
in different embedding mediums, known as carriers. The information to be hidden
can be of any form such as image, text and video etc. known as the cover medium.

<p>In this project we are planning to discuss various digital steganography
techniques, focusing primarily on image steganography techniques such as
<b>LSB, RSA TECHNIQUE</b>.</p>

# LSB:
The basic technique of hiding the data in an image is the least significant
method technique in which the data to be hidden is converted into binary
form and each bit then is hidden or replaced by the LSB bit of pixel value.
Not only one least significant bit but also two or three LSB bits can be used
for hiding depending upon the embedding capacity and the quality required
by the stego-image after the hiding process is done.
